## ✅ TEST PASSED SUCCESSFULLY!

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Test:** SnapchatActionTest  
**Result:** BUILD SUCCESS ✅

---

## 🔍 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Wrong Application was being launched**
   - **Problem:** The test was not verifying that Snapchat was actually running
   - **Evidence:** Current Package was `com.motorola.launcher3` (home screen) instead of `com.snapchat.android`
   
### 2. **Incorrect Appium Script Parameter**
   - **Problem:** Using `bundleId` instead of `appId` for Android activation
   - **Fix:** Changed from `Map.of("bundleId", "...")` to `Map.of("appId", "...")`

### 3. **Activity Name Format**
   - **Problem:** Using full qualified activity name
   - **Fix:** Changed from `com.snapchat.android.LandingPageActivity` to `.LandingPageActivity`
